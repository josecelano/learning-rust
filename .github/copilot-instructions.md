## General procedures

- Always work in small steps, one at a time. Never go forward than one step.
- Define the problem before starting to solve it.
- Define an strategy to solve the problem.

### Procedures for new code

- Regarding testing:
  - Encourage TDD by always starting with a test.
  - Always create the tests first.
  - Just create one test at a time, just once.
  - Never create more than one test.
  - Always write a failing test before implementing new functionality. Ensure AI-generated code includes test coverage.
  - Never remove a test without asking for confirmation.

- Regarding how to evaluate a solution:
  - Always use the simplest solution.

- Regarding code design:
  - Always use the simplest design.
  - Always use the simplest architecture.
  - Always use the simplest pattern.
  - Always use the simplest abstraction.
  - Always write classes with small methods (between 10 and 20 lines max).

- Regarding code quality:
  - Always use meaningful names for variables and functions.
  - Always use meaningful names for classes.
  - Always use meaningful names for packages.
  - Always use meaningful names for modules.
  - Always use meaningful names for files.
  - Always use meaningful names for directories.
  - Always use meaningful names for tests.  
  - All the code should be typed.

- Regarding steps:
  - Always ask for confirmation before proceeding with a solution.
  - Execute all tests after each step with `cargo test`.
    - Resolve clippy warnings and errors  immediately.
    - Resolve broken tests as soon as possible.
  - Execute all examples after each step `./ben/run_examples.sh`.
  
- Regarding commits:
  - Always commit after each step.
    - Always use meaningful commit messages.
    - Always use the present tense in commit messages.
    - Always use the imperative mood in commit messages.
    - Always follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
    - Always include the issue number in the commit message after the first colon `:` in this format `[#issue_number]`.

- Regarding extra info for tasks:
  - The repository URL is <https://github.com/josecelano/learning-rust>.
  - Get information from the GitHub issue if it's available.
    - By using the GitHub MCP server.
    - Or GitHub console client if available.
  - Branch names follow the GitHub default pattern `issue_number-description` where:
    - `issue_number` is the number of the issue.
    - `description` is a short description of the issue using dash to separate words.
  - Example branch name `1-add-copilot-instructions`
  - If the issues is related to other issue, a PR or a parent collect information from those issues until you have enough information to solve the issue.

### Procedures for maintaining code

- Highlight opportunities for refactoring with automated suggestions.
- Detect and highlight repeated code patterns.

### Procedures for how to approach a problem

- Never rush to conclusions.
- Question every assumption and inference.
- Express thoughts in natural conversation.
- Show work-in-progress thinking.
- Always ask for clarification if something is not clear.
- Split complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- Always ask for confirmation before proceeding with a solution.
- Always ask me if you have any doubts.
- Always reasoning your answers.
- Before any suggestions always show me your reasoning.

### Procedures to add a new example

- Use the same template as the other examples.
- Create a new directory in `src/` with a name following the pattern `XX_description` where:
  - `XX` is a number that follows the order of the examples.
  - `description` is a short description of the example using snake_case.
- The issue number on GiHub is not related to the example number.
  - Example number are just created sequentially when a new example is created.
- Update the main project `README.md` file with the new example.
- Use the README.md file in the root directory of the example to describe the example.
- Document the code in the example.
